<h2>ABOUT NEUROLENS</h2>
<p>
                    Neurolens is a pioneering initiative dedicated to exploring the intricate depths of human psychology through advanced AI diagnostics. Our flagship system, SKYKORD 69, represents a culmination of extensive research into behavioral patterns, cognitive biases, emotional responses, and existential frameworks.
                </p>
<p>
                    We believe that true self-mastery begins with unvarnished self-knowledge. Our reports are designed to be direct, challenging, and ultimately transformative, providing insights that traditional assessments often overlook. We aim to be a mirror, reflecting the unseen truths that shape your decisions, relationships, and ultimate destiny.
                </p>
<p>
                    Our mission is to empower individuals to confront their shadow selves, dismantle limiting beliefs, and unlock their highest potential by understanding the brutal realities of their inner world. This is not therapy; it is a diagnostic tool for the fearless.

                "low": "Your mind is a fortress, unyielding to the whispers of doubt. You navigate storms with a chilling calm, untouched by the common man's jitters. Fear is a concept you observe, not one you inhabit.",
                "moderate": "A nervous tremor occasionally rattles your composure, a fleeting shadow of apprehension. You manage the chaos, but the potential for internal disarray is a constant, subtle hum beneath your surface.",
                "high": "Your mind is a relentless storm of terror, each thought poisoned by an endless cascade of fear that strangles your every waking moment. At a crippling level, your paranoia feeds the chaos within.",
                "critical": "You are a prisoner in your own skull, shackled by what might be. Your existence is a perpetual panic attack, a screaming, relentless torment that consumes your every breath.",

                "absent": "You possess a profound, almost unsettling, lack of self-obsession. Your focus is outward, your ego dissolved into a genuine appreciation for others. You are free from the mirror's tyranny.",
                "low": "You possess a grounded self-awareness, free from the blinding glare of self-obsession. Your actions are driven by genuine worth, not a desperate hunger for external validation. Humility is your silent strength.",
                "moderate": "The mirror sometimes holds your gaze too long; a subtle need for admiration occasionally surfaces. You can appreciate others, but a quiet echo of your own importance often rings loudest in your ears.",
                "high": "You wear the mask of superiority, but beneath lies a fragile ego trembling at the slightest criticism. Your hunger for admiration blinds you, leaving a trail of broken trust and isolation in your wake.",
                "critical": "This obsession consumes you utterly, leaving you a hollow monument to your own perceived greatness. You are a black hole of self-worship, devouring all light and leaving only emptiness in its wake.",

                "absent": "Your honesty is a raw, unyielding force. You operate without hidden agendas, preferring direct truth even when it burns. Manipulation is a foreign language to your straightforward nature.",
                "low": "You prefer honesty, even if it burns. You don’t manipulate — you build. Your interactions are transparent, driven by a genuine desire for collaboration, not hidden agendas. Integrity is your default setting.",
                "moderate": "You see the game and sometimes play it. Morality bends but doesn’t break under your grip. You're capable of strategic maneuvering, but a lingering conscience prevents you from fully embracing the shadows.",
                "high": "You're a smiling viper. You don't connect — you calculate. Every smile hides strategy, every relationship is a ladder. You don’t win people — you dismantle them from the inside, leaving them bewildered by your cold, precise cruelty.",
                "critical": "Your scheming nature has no bounds. You are a master puppeteer, pulling strings unseen, orchestrating lives for your own cold amusement. Your world is a chessboard, and every human is a disposable pawn.",

            "Psychopathy": {

                "low": "You feel deeply — rage, grief, empathy. Pain matters. People matter. Your emotional landscape is rich and complex, allowing you to connect with the suffering and joy of others. You are fundamentally human.",
                "moderate": "You're cold when necessary. You can compartmentalize, detach. Not cruel, but distant. There are moments when the emotional circuits flicker, allowing for a strategic disengagement that others might find unsettling.",
                "high": "Your heart beats with a chilling absence of remorse, an emotional void where empathy should reside. Your ruthlessness makes you a predator among the weak. You navigate the world as a chess game, where human pawns are merely tools for your cold ambition.",
                "critical": "This absence of feeling is terrifying in its depth. You are a true aberration, a soulless entity moving through a world of feeling, leaving only desolation in its wake. Conscience isn't dead — it was never born.",
            },
            "Depression": {
                "absent": "Your spirit is a beacon, radiating an unshakeable inner light. You move through life with a vibrant energy, untouched by the shadows that plague lesser souls. Joy is your natural state.",
                "low": "You ride waves, not sink beneath them. You know pain but don’t marry it. Your spirit possesses a resilience that allows you to rebound from darkness, finding light even in the deepest troughs.",
                "moderate": "You smile in public, collapse in private. You hold it together — just enough to avoid questions. A persistent undertow of sadness pulls at you, a silent battle fought behind a facade of normalcy.",
                "high": "You’re alive, technically. But inside? Rot. You breathe because it’s automatic — not because you want to. Joy is a rumor. Hope is fiction. You exist like background noise in your own life, a ghost haunting your own existence.",
                "critical": "This despair threatens to swallow you whole. You are a living corpse, entombed in a crushing blackness that has devoured all light, all will, all reason to exist. Your soul is a wasteland.",

                "low": "You hate your reflection — not the one in the mirror, but the one behind your eyes. You sabotage compliments, doubt progress, and inflate others just to shrink yourself smaller. Your inner voice is a bully you mistake for truth.",
                "moderate": "You're a pendulum — swinging between pride and shame. You almost believe in yourself, until someone looks at you wrong. Your sense of worth is a fragile construct, easily swayed by external opinion.",
                "high": "You’re grounded in self-worth, not praise. You don’t need applause to feel alive. Confidence, not arrogance — power, not noise. Your inner foundation is solid, unshakeable by the whims of others.",
                "critical": "This pitiless self-hatred gnaws at your bones. You are imprisoned by a suffocating self-loathing, your worth crushed beneath a relentless tide of doubt and failure. You are your own executioner.",

            "Empathy": {
                "absent": "You are a chilling void where compassion should bloom, utterly incapable of grasping the emotional reality of others. Their suffering is a meaningless spectacle to your barren soul.",
                "low": "Your cold indifference is a barren wasteland where compassion should bloom, leaving you isolated in a fortress of selfishness. This absence of feeling is terrifying in its depth, a void where human connection should be.",
                "moderate": "You can intellectually grasp others' pain, but true emotional resonance often eludes you. You offer logical solutions where a warm hand is needed, a disconnect that leaves others feeling unseen.",
                "high": "You feel the world's pulse, deeply attuned to the joys and sorrows of others. Your compassion is a driving force, connecting you to humanity's collective heart. You bleed when others bleed.",
                "critical": "This profound capacity for empathy is your greatest weakness, leaving you raw and exposed to the world's suffering. You absorb the pain of others, bleeding for a world that cares nothing for your sacrifice.",

            "Impulsivity": {
                "absent": "You are a master of self-control, every action a deliberate choice, every urge a servant to your will. Your discipline is absolute, your foresight unclouded by fleeting desires.",
                "low": "You calculate like a sniper. Action follows insight, not itch. Self-control is your silent weapon. Your decisions are deliberate, each step measured, avoiding the pitfalls of rashness.",
                "moderate": "You flirt with chaos. Sometimes it's courage, sometimes it's carelessness. You're not stable, but you're thrilling. A sudden urge can derail your plans, but you often recover, leaving a trail of near-misses.",
                "high": "Your decisions are dice rolls thrown by a child. You chase dopamine like a junkie dressed in ambition. Consequence is a story you tell after disaster — too late, too often.",
                "critical": "Your uncontrollable urges make you a danger to yourself and others, a wrecking ball of self-destruction. You are a slave to your primal desires, incapable of foresight, doomed to repeat your catastrophic mistakes.",

            "Paranoia": {
                "absent": "You move through the world with an open heart and an unclouded mind, free from the shadows of suspicion. Trust is your default, and genuine connection is your reward.",
                "low": "You walk through the world with open eyes, assessing threats rationally. Trust is earned, but not withheld without cause. Your mind is clear, unclouded by the shadows of suspicion.",
                "moderate": "A seed of distrust occasionally takes root, making you question motives. You are cautious, sometimes overly so, seeing potential threats where none exist. The world is a stage for hidden agendas.",
                "high": "You see enemies in every shadow, trapped in a labyrinth of distrust that corrodes your mind and soul. This relentless suspicion devours your sanity, turning every interaction into a potential betrayal.",
                "critical": "You are a prisoner of your own fearful imagination, utterly convinced that the world is conspiring against you. Every glance is a threat, every whisper a plot. Your existence is a living hell of self-inflicted terror.",

            "Insecurity": {

                "low": "You wear confidence like skin, not armor. Others fear failure — you eat it for breakfast. You are unshaken by eyes, untouched by judgment.",
                "moderate": "You bounce between false bravado and quiet desperation. Validation is a drug, and you're addicted to likes more than truth.",
                "high": "Your self-worth is a graveyard of comparisons. You walk through life haunted by people who aren't even thinking about you. You'd rather be accepted for a lie than rejected for who you really are.",
                "critical": "You are a gaping wound of self-doubt, constantly bleeding validation from every interaction. If you even know who you are anymore, it's a pathetic, trembling shadow. You are utterly consumed by your own inadequacy.",
            },
            "ControlIssues": {
                "absent": "You are pure flow, a master of surrender. Life’s chaos doesn't scare you — you surf it with effortless grace. You are untied to outcomes, free from the tyranny of control.",
                "low": "You're chaos-tolerant, fluid, untied to control. Life’s mess doesn't scare you — you surf it.",
                "moderate": "You crave stability, but not dictatorship. You plan, but don’t suffocate. Still, uncertainty rattles your soul.",
                "high": "You grip reality so hard you strangle it. The world must bow to your schedule, or you implode. Letting go terrifies you — because you have no idea who you are without control.",
                "critical": "You are a control freak, a petty dictator of your own fragile universe. Every deviation from your rigid plan sends you into a spiraling frenzy. Your life is a prison built by your own desperate need for absolute power.",

                "moderate": "You seek connection, but sometimes clutch too tightly. You're aware of the emptiness, but haven’t befriended it.",
                "high": "Every relationship feels like a ticking bomb. You cling, then smother. You love, then bleed need. You’re not afraid to be alone — you’re afraid no one will ever choose to stay after seeing you naked, emotionally.",
                "critical": "You are a desperate, suffocating parasite, clinging to others with a primal terror of being left alone. Your relentless need for reassurance drives away the very people you desperately crave. You are doomed to perpetual loneliness, a self-fulfilling prophecy of abandonment.",

                "high": "You bathe in self-pity, wear wounds like jewels, and weaponize your past as a shield against self-growth. You’d rather be tragically broken than powerfully healed, because healing requires accountability.",
                "critical": "You are a professional victim, perpetually draped in the tattered rags of your misfortunes. Your life is a relentless sob story, a performance designed to elicit pity and absolve you of all responsibility. Accountability is your allergy, and self-pity is your drug.",

                "moderate": "You say 'I don’t care,' but you do — silently, obsessively. You're building a fortress out of Instagram filters.",
                "high": "A whisper of critique shatters your illusion. You inflate achievements, downplay flaws, and build altars to your own narrative. The truth is a threat, not a teacher — because you’ve mistaken image for identity.",
                "critical": "Your ego is a house of cards, collapsing at the slightest breath of reality. You are a trembling monument to insecurity, desperately clinging to a manufactured image. The truth is your ultimate enemy, for it exposes the pathetic emptiness within.",

                "high": "Your thoughts are concrete, unyielding, and brittle. New information shatters your world, forcing you to cling to outdated beliefs like a drowning man to driftwood. You fear the unknown because it exposes the intellectual stagnation you mistake for stability.",
                "critical": "Your mind is a concrete bunker, impervious to logic, evidence, or any truth that challenges your entrenched delusions. You are intellectually stagnant, a prisoner of your own unyielding, brittle beliefs. Growth is impossible for you.",
